*Note: This project contains a VS Code Dev Container descriptor to ease your setup. Therefore, I highly recommend using VS code to work with this project.* 

Steps to run this project:

1. Clone this Git repository
2. Navigate to the folder `GlobomanticsInventoryApp`

To stop the application, run the stop.sh script.
